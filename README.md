## My Process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS Custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I should not be using a lot of fixed units on creating responsive website containers and elements, so upon changing the scale of the screen, orientation and device, the web elements will follow and scale down/up depends on pixel of the machine

### Continued development

I need to be more familiar on CSS, I forgot a lot of things and jumping on google and mdn just to check on some functions and how it should be done, I know it's a good practice yet it takes a bit of time and bit a waste to finish the project faster.

### Useful resources

- [mdn CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
